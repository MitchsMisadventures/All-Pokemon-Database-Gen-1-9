# All Pokemon Database (Generations I-IV)

Created a repo with useful Pokemon databases in an organized `.csv` format. Databases were created with data from [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number) but edited in excel by hand!

If you have any suggestions, recommendations, or **corrections**, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter! [@MitchsMistweets](https://www.twitter.com/MitchsMistweets).

## Current List of Tables

- [Pokemon Typings](#pokemon-typings)

## Pokemon Typings

Simple database that has the Pokemon and its Primary and Secondary typings. 

*NOTE:* The `Special Form` column will only have a different entry of the same Pokemon if and only if the alternate form has a different typing than the original. For example, the different Rotom forms have their own entries since they have different typings but Deoxys only has one entry since all of the different forms have the same typing.
